This is a semi-automatic program that plays Cisco's Binary Game For You

# How To
To run the program correctly, use VS Code.  Change your working directory to where "binaryGameCode.py" is located in the VS terminal. 
Have all the images folder, "bgPics" in the same directory. 
Go to https://learningcontent.cisco.com/games/binary/index.html and make browser full screen. 
Place VS Code in upper-left corner of the screen, allowing the last bottom row of binary code to be in view.
If you run Unbuntu and maybe any other linux distros, you can click on VS Code and press alt + space and choose to
make VS Code Stay on top.  For windows, you can download a software to do the same thing, here is the link for more info,

You can also just alt + tab to switch between windows.
Be present while running the program as it will prompt you to enter numbers highlighted in green at the bottom row.

# Issues
This program is not fully automatic, I have developed this not knowing selenium was a thing.  
The other issue is the program couldn't determine which images where the same or different.
