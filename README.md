# CiscoBinaryGame
This is a semi-automatic program that plays Cisco's Binary Game For You

# How To
To run the program correctly, use VS Code.  Change your working directory to where "binaryGameCode.py" is located in the VS terminal. 
Have all the images folder, "bgPics" in the same directory. 
Go to https://learningcontent.cisco.com/games/binary/index.html and make browser full screen. 
Place VS Code in upper-left corner of the screen, allowing the last bottom row of binary code to be in view.
Be present while running the program as it will prompt you to enter numbers highlighted in green at the bottom row.

# Issues
This program is not fully automatic, I have developed this not knowing selenium was a thing.  
The other issue is the program couldn't determine which images where the same or different.
